# Palmoria Group Employee Data Analysis

## Overview

The "Palmoria Group emp-data.csv" dataset contains employee information including Name, Gender, Department, Salary, Location, and Performance Rating. The data has some inconsistencies (e.g., missing values for Gender, Department, Salary, and Rating) and covers a wide variety of roles and locations.

---

## 1. **Gender Distribution**

- **Females**: Predominant in the dataset, occupying a wide range of departments.
- **Males**: Present in all departments but less represented than females.
- **Missing**: A number of entries have missing gender data.

**Implication**: The company appears to have a fairly balanced gender representation but should work to address missing demographic data for better diversity tracking.

---

## 2. **Departmental Spread**

- **Top Departments**: Product Management, Sales, Human Resources, Support, Engineering, Services, Marketing, Business Development, Legal, Training, Research and Development, and Accounting.
- **Departments with NULL/Empty Entries**: Some employees have no department listed, which could indicate contractors, new hires, or data entry errors.

**Implication**: The workforce is distributed across many business functions, indicating a diversified business model. Data hygiene should be improved for analytics accuracy.

---

## 3. **Salary Analysis**

- **Salary Range**: Varies widely from as low as ~28,000 to nearly 120,000+ currency units (presumably Naira).
- **Missing Data**: Several entries have blank salary fields.
- **High Earners**: Typically found in Product Management, Sales, Research & Development, and some Support roles.
- **Low Earners**: Frequently in Accounting, Services, and some Support roles.

**Implication**: There is significant salary inequality, which may be justified by role or seniority but should be periodically reviewed for fairness and market competitiveness.

## 4. **Location Distribution**

- **Main Locations**: Lagos, Abuja, Kaduna.
- **Distribution**: Employee base is well spread across these three cities, though some locations appear more frequently in specific departments.

**Implication**: Palmoria Group has a multi-city presence, which can be leveraged for regional market coverage.

---

## 5. **Performance Ratings**

- **Ratings Used**: Very Good, Good, Average, Poor, Very Poor, Not Rated.
- **Distribution**:
  - Many employees are rated "Average" or "Good".
  - A noticeable segment is "Not Rated"â€”potentially new hires or missing performance data.
  - Fewer are rated "Very Poor" or "Poor", but this still represents a non-negligible group.

**Implication**: The majority of staff are performing at an acceptable or better level. However, the company should investigate those with consistently low ratings and address the "Not Rated" segment to ensure everyone is being evaluated.

---

## 6. **Data Quality Issues**

- **Missing Values**: Gender, Department, Salary, and Rating fields are missing in several rows.
- **Duplicate Names**: Some names (e.g., Joella Maevela, Brose MacCorkell, etc.) appear more than once, which could be due to data entry errors or actual rehires.

**Recommendation**: Improve data collection and entry processes, perform regular audits, and establish unique employee identifiers.

---

## 7. **Key Insights & Recommendations**

- **Diversity**: Gender balance is reasonable but could be further improved and tracked by ensuring complete demographic data.
- **Talent Distribution**: High performers and high earners are concentrated in a few departments. Consider expanding talent development programs to lower-paid roles.
- **Performance Management**: Address the "Not Rated" employees to improve the performance review process.
- **Salary Review**: Conduct periodic salary benchmarking to ensure internal equity and external competitiveness.
- **Data Quality**: Implement stricter data entry protocols and periodic cleansing to enable more accurate analytics.

## 8. **Potential Next Steps for Deeper Analysis**

- Correlate salary vs. performance rating by department and gender.
- Analyze attrition risk based on performance and pay bands.
- Drill down into city-wise talent and department strengths.

**Summary**:  
The Palmoria Group's workforce is diverse in both function and geography. While most employees are performing at or above average, there are notable issues with missing data and some salary disparities. Addressing these will unlock better HR and business insights.
